# Readings recommended to junior devs

During my career, I had the opportunity of growing up some junior developers. The more the number of devs I know grows up the more I need a place to store what are the resources I recommended them to read.

That's the meaning of this repository, it's useful just to me to avoid repeating myself and looking for the exact link I send to him in that particular day on that particular Slack channel etc. etc. ...

## Cristina (2018)

Cristina had a really basic knowledge of CSS at the time and my goal was to introduce her to the modern web design world. I recommended her to read:

- An introduction to [web design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)
- the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) language
- CSS [FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- the [Bootstrap docs](getbootstrap.com/docs)
- the [Jen Simmons's video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u00FY9vADfQ&t)
- the [Git flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) I use

## Luca (2017)

Luca was already an experienced PHP/WordPress developer and his goal was to jump into the front-end world, so:

- the amazing [How Browsers Work](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/) article
- another must-to-read is the [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book
- [Best Practices for Perfect CSS Documentation](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/css-documentation-best-practices--cms-30139)

## Davide (2019)

Davide was a SEO expert and moved into the Front-end development with JavaScript and VueJS. I sent him the same readings for Luca, adding:

- [The Little JavaScript book](https://www.valentinog.com/little-javascript) (available in Italian too: [Il Piccolo Libro di JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/piccolo-javascript/))
